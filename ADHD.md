### Did you know that your brain reads faster than your eye?

> We humans store learned words and so just a few letters are enough to recognize whole words.

Bionic Reading is a new method facilitating the reading process by guiding the eyes through text with artificial fixation points.
As a result the reader is only focusing on the highlighted initial letters and lets the brain center complete the word. In a digital world dominated by shallow forms of reading, Bionic Reading aims to encourage a more in-depth reading and understanding of written content.
