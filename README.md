## Who am I & What I do?
I am passionate about **penetration testing** and enjoy **coding** in my free time. I have experience in **scripting languages** and am always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow. In my [repos](https://github.com/haithamaouati?tab=repositories), you'll find a combination of [scripts](https://github.com/haithamaouati?tab=repositories) and [gists](https://gist.github.com/haithamaouati) approaches.
